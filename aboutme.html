          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>I am an enthusiastic undergrad from MBM University Jodhpur, pursuing bachelor's in technology in Electronics and Computers. I am currently learning React JS and have knowledge of the languages mentioned below. I have completed several projects, which include making personal as well as professional websites and basic Javascript games. Meanwhile, in co-curricular activities, I play for my college football team and have been to the Nationals too. My hobbies are reading books and practising my communication skills by interacting with new people. I am a public speaker as well. I love debating, giving speeches, and with a pinch of standup comedy.<br>Being a football player, I know the importance of teamwork in all fields. At times, I can act as a great leader for the team as well.
